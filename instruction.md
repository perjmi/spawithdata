I would like for you to inspect ../newspa thoroughly. As you can see, the spa is serving some png's each of which hold some chart data.

I would like for you to refactor this into a spawithdata page which rather than loading predefined charts calculate the charts within the spa. In order to do this,
the spa obviously need the 5 min data for the various instruments.

Can I ask you to make a thorough plan for how to implement this. Once done, upload the entire SPA to github just like the newspa one.
